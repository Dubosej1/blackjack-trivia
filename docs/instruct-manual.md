This screen displays a list of ALL the outcomes the PLAYER had over the course of the round.

At the top of the list are the “Base Round” outcomes.  These are the same as the outcomes from the “Round Outcome” screen.  The PLAYER’s round outcome will be listed, along with the Payout and any winnings they received.  If the PLAYER played SPLIT HANDS, then each split hand will be listed separately.

After the “Base Round” outcomes, all of the “Side Bet” outcomes will be listed.  Each Side Bet will be listed, along with their outcome, any winnings received, the win condition fulfilled and the payout for the win condition.

At the bottom of the screen is the [CLOSE] button.  Press this button to close the screen and return to the “Total Winnings” Screen.
