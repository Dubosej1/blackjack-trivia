# Blackjack Trivia App Documentation

## Overview

This app combines the fun of Blackjack with the excitement of trivia!  

Place bets on whether you can beat the dealer in a game of Blackjack.  The same rules for Blackjack apply to this game as well, except in order to draw extra cards for your hand, you have to successfully answer a trivia question.  

There’s a variety of categories for the trivia questions, across 3 levels of difficulty.  Depending on the level of difficulty you select, you can earn or lose trivia credits.

It’s GAME OVER when you either run out of money to bet with or you run out of trivia credits.

You can customize your Blackjack Trivia experience through a variety of options.  There’s also a number of side bets you can place, in order to earn extra money on top of the base bet.

Good Luck!
