# SIDE BETS

## Overview
***

In this game app, you can place a number of [SIDE BETS] for each round, in addition to the [BASE BET].  These Side Bets have their own individual rules, conditions and win payouts.  They offer extra excitement to the game, so take advantage of them when possible.

This page will list all of the available Side Bets, their rules and their [PAYOUT TABLES].

Some Side Bets will have special functionality that will be displayed in their own screens during the game.  This will be noted in the Side Bets' sections and the screens will be reviewed in-depth.

>**NOTE**:

>INSURANCE and EVEN MONEY are [CORE SIDE BETS] that are separate and won’t be covered in this section.  See ["Insurance"](basic-rules.md#insurance) and ["Even Money"](basic-rules.md#even-money) in the Basic Rules Section for more info on these bets.

>Side Bet rules have terms that are separate from the base game.  Words in [ ] are keywords and their definitions can be found in the ["Terms"](terms.md) section of the documentation.

You are betting on whether PLAYER’s Initial Hand equals a total of 11 pts, in specific ways.  

For the purposes of this Side Bet, a `NATURAL` also counts as an 11 pt hand, since an ACE and a [TEN-CARD] can also equal 11 pts.

### Jackpot Ace

This Side Bet features a `Jackpot Ace`.

The `Jackpot Ace` is an `ACE-SPADE` that is specially marked.  It’s only encountered 1 out of every 6 times an `ACE-SPADE` is drawn.  The `Jackpot Ace` is needed to reach the higher payouts.

### Infinity Dice

This Side Bet also features 3 `Infinity Dice`.

The `Infinity Dice` are 3 six-sided dice that each have 5 blank sides and 1 side that features the infinity symbol.  When PLAYER rolls the dice and gets `Infinity` symbols, they can be used to receive higher payouts.

When PLAYER wins this Side Bet with a [SUITED] 11 pt Hand (which will referred to as a "SUITED 11"), then the “PERFECT 11s DICE ROLL SCREEN" will appear during the start of the round.  PLAYER can use this screen to roll the `Infinity Dice`.  See below for more info on this screen.

#### Winning Hand Field

In the upper left hand portion of the screen is the “WINNING HAND FIELD”.  This field displays PLAYER’S Initial Hand, used to win the side bet.  The field also displays the [WIN CONDITION] that PLAYER’s Hand fulfilled and the [PAYOUT] for it.

| `[Collect Bet Amount and Winnings]` |          No Change in Base Bet         |

|         `[Parlay Winnings]`         |        `Base Bet` + `Winnings`         |
|            `[Parlay All]`           | `Base Bet` + `Bet Amount` + `Winnings` |

If you press the `[COLLECT BET AND WINNINGS]` button, PLAYER will receive their House Money Bet back plus their Winnings.  This doesn’t affect the Base Bet, so the right hand column displays “No Change”.

If you press the `[PARLAY BET]` button, PLAYER will receive only their Winnings.  The House Money Bet gets `Parlayed` into the Base Bet, with the new bet amount shown in the right hand column.

If you press the `[PARLAY WINNINGS]` button, PLAYER will receive only their House Money Bet back.  The Winnings get `Parlayed` into the Base Bet, with the new bet amount shown in the right hand column.

If PLAYER presses the `[PARLAY ALL]` button, PLAYER will receive no money back at all.  The House Money Bet and winnings both get `Parlayed` into the Base Bet, with the new Base Bet amount shown in the right hand column.
