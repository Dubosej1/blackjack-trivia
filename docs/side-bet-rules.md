Perfect 11s

This Side Bet is played with the PLAYER’s initial 2 cards

You are betting on whether the PLAYER’s initial 2 cards equal a total of 11 pts, in specific ways.

-The Jackpot Ace is a SPADE ACE that is specially marked.  It’s only encountered 1 out of every 6 times a SPADE ACE is drawn.  The Jackpot Ace is needed to reach the higher payouts.

-The Infinity Dice are 3 six-sided dice that each have 5 blank sides and 1 side that features the infinity symbol.  When the PLAYER rolls the dice and gets infinity symbols, they can be used to receive higher payouts.

When the PLAYER wins this Side Bet with a SUITED 11, then the “Perfect 11s Dice Roll” Screen will appear during the start of the round.  The PLAYER can use this screen to roll the Infinity Dice.  See below for more info on this screen.

Extra Bet Menu

You can use the [CHIP] buttons to add money to the Extra Bet.  The “Current Bet Field” (large purple circle) will update to show your current bet amount.  The Bank and Fee fields will also update to reflect their current values.
If you want to clear the bet, use the [CLEAR BET] button to reset all values back to their starting values.

When you’re ready to place the extra bet, use the [PLACE EXTRA BET] button to confirm it.  This will exit the screen.

Decide House Money Screen

When the PLAYER wins the Side Bet and the DEALER doesn’t have a NATURAL, then the “Decide House Money Screen” can appear.  After the PLAYER’s initial 2 cards are dealt, the PLAYER can press the [CHECK SIDE BETS] button and this screen will be displayed.

In the upper left hand portion of the screen is  the “Winning Hand Field”.  This field displays the PLAYER’S initial 2 cards used to win the side bet.  The field also displays the  WIN CONDITION that the PLAYER’s HAND fulfilled and the payout for it.

In the upper right hand portion of the screen is the “Player Info Field”.  The “Bank Field” shows the PLAYER’s current BANK value.  The “Base Bet Field” shows the PLAYER’s current BASE BET value.  The “Side Bet Field” shows the amount of money that the PLAYER placed on the HOUSE MONEY Side Bet.  The “Winnings Field” shows the amount of money the PLAYER won from winning the Side Bet.

The bottom half of the screen displays a table of actions the PLAYER can take, regarding the Side Bet.  The left column shows the list of actions.  The right column shows the new amount of the Base Bet, after the PLAYER selects the corresponding action.

If the PLAYER presses the [COLLECT BET AND WINNINGS] button, the PLAYER will receive their House Money Bet back plus their winnings.  This doesn’t affect the Base Bet, so the right hand column displays “No Change”.

If the PLAYER presses the [PARLAY BET] button, the PLAYER will receive only their winnings.  The House Money Bet gets PARLAYED into the Base Bet, with the new bet amount shown in the right hand column.

If the PLAYER presses the [PARLAY WINNINGS] button, the PLAYER will receive only their House Money Bet back.  The winnings get PARLAYED into the Base Bet, with the new bet amount shown in the right hand column.
